## [0.2.4](https://github.com/denehoffman/laddu/releases/tag/py-laddu-v0.2.4) - 2025-01-26

### Added

- add `BinnedGuideTerm` under new `experimental` module
- allow users to add `Dataset`s together to form a new `Dataset`

### Fixed

- fixed python examples and readme paths
- modify tests and workflows to new structure

### Other

- bump py-laddu version

- manually update py-laddu version
- omit tests and docs in python coverage
- correct path of extensions module
- _(py-laddu)_ release v0.2.0
